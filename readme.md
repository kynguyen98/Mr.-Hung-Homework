Short-term (CPU scheduler)—selects from jobs in memory those jobs that areready to execute and allocates the CPU to them.<br>
Medium-term—used especially with time-sharing systems as an intermediatescheduling level. A swapping scheme is implemented to remove partially runprograms from memory and reinstate them later to continue where they leftoff.<br>
Long-term (job scheduler)—determines which jobs are brought into memoryfor processing.The primary difference is in the frequency of their execution.
